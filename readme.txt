Using Texting for ***customer service*** and ***support*** is easy with the Text Message SMS Extension for WooCommerce by [Biz Text](https://biztextsolutions.com/?ref=wp%20sms%20extension%20for%20woocommerce). Send order SMS notifications to your customer's mobile phone.

Easily enable and configure SMS Notifications in the Text Message SMS tab in WooCommerce settings. Be ready in minutes by setting options in the three sections:

1. Initialize: Enter a Biz Text Id to activate SMS, enter notification number to enable admin notifications, customize and add a Mobile Phone field or use existing phone field in billing details
1. Customer SMS Notification: Enable and customize, with placeholders, customer SMS notification templates
1. Admin SMS Notification: Enable and customize, with placeholders, admin SMS notification templates

By default, the number to send SMS notifications is in an additional field under customers billing details, called Mobile Phone. Customers placing new orders will enter the number and receive order SMS notifications. Existing orders will not receive SMS unless:

1. A mobile number is entered and updated in Order details (Enabling, Use the number in Phone field will copy and place in Mobile Phone Number)
1. Using a bulk action in the orders list to enable SMS by duplicating and putting the phone number in the mobile number field
1. Mobile phone field is disabled, using the number in the phone field (Note: this may not be a mobile number)

Enabled SMS notifications are sent automatically for a new order and when order status changes by WooCommerce, the Payment Gateway, or by you, the store owner. Custom SMS can be sent in order details and recorded in the order notes.
